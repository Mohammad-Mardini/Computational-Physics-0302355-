**Lecture Title:** Introduction to Jupyter Notebook and Scientific Libraries in Python  

---


## Getting Started with Jupyter Notebook
- **What is Jupyter Notebook?**
  - An interactive computing environment for Python and other languages
  - Used for coding, data visualization, and documentation in one place
- **Installation and launching Jupyter:**
  - Install via Anaconda, `pip install jupyter`, or system package managers
  - Launch Jupyter using `jupyter notebook` in the terminal
- **Navigating the Jupyter interface:**
  - Understanding the notebook dashboard
  - Creating, renaming, and organizing notebooks
  - Difference between code cells and markdown cells

- **Google Colab:**
  - An alternative to Jupyter Notebook that runs in the cloud
  - No installation required, accessible via [https://colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com)
  - Free GPU access for machine learning and heavy computations
  - Supports collaborative work with Google Drive integration

### **Hands-on Activity:**
  - Create Google Colab profile and open Notebook
  - Run basic Python commands (`print("Hello, World!")`, `1+1`)
  - Add and format text in markdown cells (headings, bullet points, equations)
  - Open Google Colab and create a new notebook



### **Essential Features of Google Colab:**
- **Cloud-based execution:** No need to install Python locally
- **GPU and TPU support:** Accelerate deep learning and scientific computations
- **Automatic saving:** Notebooks are saved directly in Google Drive
- **Code execution:** Supports Python and Jupyter-style notebooks
- **Collaboration:** Multiple users can edit the same notebook in real time
- **Built-in libraries:** Pre-installed packages like NumPy, Pandas, and TensorFlow
- **File handling:** Easy upload and download of files, access to Google Drive
- **Magic commands:** Similar to Jupyter, includes `%timeit`, `%matplotlib inline`, etc.

## Introduction to Scientific Libraries
### **NumPy (Numerical Computing)**
- Why NumPy? Performance benefits over lists
- Creating NumPy arrays and performing basic operations
- Indexing, slicing, and reshaping arrays
- Vectorized operations and broadcasting

### **Matplotlib (Data Visualization)**
- Basics of Matplotlib and the `pyplot` module
- Creating line plots, scatter plots, and histograms
- Customizing plots with titles, labels, and legends
- Using `%matplotlib inline` for inline plots in Jupyter

### **Pandas (Data Handling)**
- Introduction to DataFrames and Series
- Reading and writing CSV and Excel files
- Filtering, grouping, and summarizing data
- Handling missing values and basic statistical operations

### **Hands-on Activity:**
- Create and manipulate a NumPy array
- Plot a simple graph using Matplotlib
- Load a CSV file into Pandas and explore the dataset
