## **4. Practical Example: Python vs. Other Languages**  
Letâ€™s compare Python with C++ by computing the sum of squares from 1 to 1,000,000.  

### **C++ Code:**  
```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    long long sum = 0;
    for(int i = 1; i <= 1000000; i++) {
        sum += i * i;
    }
    std::cout << sum;
    return 0;
}
```  

### **Python Code:**  
```python
sum_of_squares = sum(i**2 for i in range(1, 1000001))
print(sum_of_squares)
```  
âœ… **Pythonâ€™s code is shorter, cleaner, and easier to write!**

## **5. Hands-On Exercise: First Python Script**  
1. Install Python (if not already installed).  
2. Open a Jupyter Notebook or Python script.  
3. Run the following code:  

```python
import numpy as np

# Generate an array of numbers from 1 to 1000
numbers = np.arange(1, 1001)

# Compute the square of each number
squared_numbers = numbers ** 2

# Calculate the sum
sum_squares = np.sum(squared_numbers)

print("Sum of squares:", sum_squares)
```
